## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ This is the ETH Programming, Education, and Computer-Human Interaction Lab ([PEACH Lab](https://peachlab.inf.ethz.ch/)). 

🌈 We adopt a human-centered approach to hack around with programming tools, enhancing their effectiveness and accessibility for a wide range of applications (e.g., learning, collaboration, data science, prompt engineering, and more).
